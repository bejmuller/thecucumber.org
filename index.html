  <title>The Cucumber</title>
  <meta name="description" content="The cucumber is a battle-proven geo-positioning tool. The festivalgoer's best friend. A must-have bookmark for every occasion. Whenever you are lost in a crowd, just open the site, hold your phone up and let your group know that the cucumber has been engaged. Your friends will notice you from far since no one else is stupid enough to show a picture of a cucumber in the middle of a party. Profit.">
